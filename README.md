# Project-BDA


This project was developed for an assignment in the course Big Data Algorithms. Within this project, a very short introduction into synthetic data was developped. The slides of this introduction can be found in this repository. This code was developed to illustrate how synthetic data can look like and how synthetic data can be evaluated. Some figures produced by this code, can be found in the presentation.

In the code, we first simulated an original dataset and generated synthetic versions using two generative models: **CTGAN** and **TVAE**. We focused on evaluating the synthetic data and the privacy-utility trade-off. 

The methods to generate and evaluate synthetic data are by no means exhaustive. GAN and VAE are two popular generation techniques based on neural networks, hence we chose to variations of these techniques to showcase how synthetic data generation works. As for the evaluation, there is no common way researchers agree on how to properly evaluate similarity, utility or privacy of synthetic data. Therefor, a small selection of what seems to be regularly done is demonstrated here.

- `Privacy.py`                    :  The evaluation of the Membership Inference Attack measure for privacy.
- `Simulation_example_data.py` : Simulates data for original dataset.
- `SyntheticGAN.py`               : Generates synthetic data using CTGAN.
- `SyntheticVAE.py`               : Generates synthetic data using TVAE.
- `Utility.py`                    : Predictive performance evaluations to compare how useful a synthetic dataset is compared to the original data.



## üöÄ How to run
